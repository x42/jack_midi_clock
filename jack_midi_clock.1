seconds between 'song\-position' and 'continue' message
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-no\-position\fR
do not send song\-position (0xf2) messages

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version information and exit
.PP
jack_midi_clock sends MIDI beat clock message if jack\-transport is rolling.
it also sends start, continue and stop MIDI realtime messages whenever
the transport changes state (unless \fB\-T\fR option is used).
.PP
In order for jack_midi_clock to send clock messages, a JACK timecode master
must be present and provide the tempo map (bar, beat, tick).
Alternatively the \fB\-b\fR option can be used to set a default BPM value.
If a value larger than zero is given, it will be used if no timecode master
is present. Combined with the \fB\-B\fR option it can used to override and ignore
the JACK timecode master and only act on transport state alone.
.PP
Either way, jack_midi_clock will never act as timecode master itself.
.PP
Note that song\-position information is only sent if a timecode master is
present ad the \fB\-P\fR option is not given.
.PP
To allow external synths to accurately sync to song\-position, there is a two
second delay between the 'song\-position changed' message (which is not a MIDI
realtime message) and the 'continue transport' message.
This delay can be configured with the \fB\-d\fR option and is only relevant for if
playback starts at a bar|beat|tick other than 1|1|0 in which case a 'start'
message is sent immediately.
.PP
jack_midi_clock runs until it receives a HUP or INT signal or jackd is
terminated.
